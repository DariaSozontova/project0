# Project 0
for the purpose of this project i chose to represent psychology as one of my interests.
in this trial web site the information is taken from wikipedia and DK books only for exercise purpose.

index file includes main page of my site.
it includes row and columns, id, class, a list, images and links to other pages. Index.html is connected
to stylemain.css for styling.

Second page is Psy.html it includes a table and buttons to link it to other pages which are not visible in print as well as a form that doesn't yet lid anywhere (but potentially would let a user choose any page from the site)

Third page is Beh.html it has a responsive image design, a list of links to different page parts as well as buttons similar to psy.html that would allow a user to navigate to different pages

Forth page is Dev.html it has a different layout using class "card" and columns/rows, a list to different
site parts and buttons.

Main page has a warning message made with bootstrap, and Psy.html, Beh.html and Dev.html have messages
created using inheritance.

Psy.html, Beh.html and Dev.html are connected to stylesheet.scss, have responsive design according to page size and all of the pages have bootstrap
