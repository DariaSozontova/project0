  <h2 id="one">B. F. Skinner</h2>
       <p>Burrhus Frederic Skinner, better known as B.F. Skinner, is possibly the most widely known and influential behaviorist psychologist. He  was not, however, a pioneer in the field, but developed the ideas of his predecessors, such as Ivan Pavlov and John B. Watson, by subjecting theories of behaviorism to rigorous experimental scrutiny in order to arrive at his controversial stance  of “radical behaviorism.” Skinner proved to be an ideal advocate of behaviorism. Not only were his arguments based on the results of scrupulous scientific methodology (so they could be proved), but his experiments tended to involve the use of novel contraptions that the general public found fascinating. Skinner was an inveterate “gadget man” and a provocative self-publicist. But behind the showman image was  a serious scientist, whose work helped to finally sever psychology from its introspective philosophical roots and establish it as a scientific discipline in its own right. Skinner had once contemplated a career as an author, but he had  little time for the philosophical theorizing of many of the early psychologists. Works by Pavlov  and Watson were his main influence; he saw psychology as following in the scientific tradition, and anything that could not been seen, measured, and repeated in a rigorously controlled experiment was of no interest to him.  Processes purely of the mind, therefore, were outside Skinner’s interest and scope. In fact, he reached the conclusion that they must be utterly subjective, and  did not exist at all separately from the body. In Skinner’s opinion,  the way to carry out psychological research was through observable behavior, rather than through unobservable thoughts. Although a strict behaviorist from the outset of his career, Skinner differed from earlier behaviorists in his interpretation of conditioning, in particular, the principle of “classical conditioning” as described by Pavlov. While not disagreeing that a conditioned response could be elicited by repeated training, Skinner felt that this was something of a special case, involving the deliberate, artificial introduction of a conditioning stimulus. To Skinner, it seemed that  the consequences of an action  were more important in shaping behavior than any stimulus that had preceded or coincided with it. He concluded from his experiments that behavior is primarily learned from the results of actions. As with so many great insights, this may appear to be self-evident, but it marked a major turning point in behaviorist psychology.
       </p>
  <h2 id="two">Skinner boxes</h2>
       <p>While working as a research fellow at Harvard, Skinner carried out a series of experiments on rats, using an invention that later became known as a “Skinner box.” A rat was placed in one of these boxes, which had a special bar fitted on the inside. Every time the rat pressed this bar, it was presented with a food pellet. The rate of  bar-pressing was automatically recorded. Initially, the rat might press the bar accidentally, or  simply out of curiosity, and as a consequence receive some food. Over time, the rat learned that food appeared whenever the bar was pressed, and began to press it purposefully in order to be fed. Comparing results from rats given the “positive reinforcement” of food for their bar-pressing behavior with those that were not, or were presented with food at different rates, it became clear that when food appeared as a consequence  of the rat’s actions, this influenced its future behavior.Skinner concluded that animals are conditioned by the responses they receive from their actions  and environment. As the rats explored the world around them, some of their actions had a positive consequence (Skinner was careful to avoid the word “reward” with its connotations of being given for “good” behavior), which in turn encouraged them to repeat that behavior. In Skinner’s terms,  an “organism"  operates on its environment, and encounters a stimulus (a food pellet), which reinforces its operant behavior (pressing on the bar). In order to distinguish this from classical conditioning, he coined the term “operant conditioning;” the major distinction being that operant conditioning depends not on a preceding stimulus, but on what follows as a consequence of a particular type of behavior. It is also different in that it represents  a two-way process, in which an action, or behavior, is operating  on the environment just as much  as the environment is shaping  that behavior. In the course of his experiments, Skinner began to run short of food pellets, forcing him to reschedule the rate at which they were being given to the rats. Some rats now received a food pellet only after they had pressed the bar a number of times repeatedly, either at fixed intervals or randomly. The results of this variation reinforced Skinner’s original findings, but they also led to a further discovery: that while  a reinforcing stimulus led to a greater probability of a behavior occurring, if the reinforcing stimulus was then stopped, there was a decrease in the likelihood of that behavior occurring.Skinner continued making his experiments ever more varied and sophisticated, including changes of schedule to establish whether the rats could distinguish and respond to differences in the rate of delivery of food pellets. As he suspected, the rats adapted very quickly to  the new schedules.

  <h2 id="three">Negative reinforcement</h2>
       <p>In later experiments, the floors of the Skinner boxes were each fitted with an electric grid, which would give the rats an unpleasant shock whenever they were activated. This allowed for the investigation of the effect of negative reinforcement on behavior. Again, just as Skinner avoided the word “reward,” he was careful not to describe the electric shock as “punishment,” a distinction that became increasingly important as he examined the implications of his research. Negative reinforcement was not a new concept in psychology. As early as 1890, William James had written in Principles of Psychology: “Animals, for example, awaken in  a child the opposite impulses of fearing and fondling. But if a child, in his first attempts to pat a dog, gets snapped at or bitten, so that the impulse of fear is strongly aroused, it may be that for years to come no dog will excite in him the impuls to fondle again." Skinner was to provide the experimental evidence for this idea.
       </p>
  <h2 id="four">Positive reinforcement</h2>
       <p>As expected, Skinner found that whenever a behavior resulted in the negative consequence of an electric shock, there was a decrease in that behavior. He went on to redesign the Skinner boxes used in the experiment, so that the rats inside were able to switch off the electrified grid by pressing a bar, which provided a form of positive reinforcement arising from the removal of a negative stimulus. The results that followed confirmed Skinner’s theory—if a behavior leads to the removal of a negative stimulus, that behavior increases.However, the results also revealed an interesting distinction between behavior learned by positive reinforcement and behavior elicited by negative stimuli. The rats responded better and more quickly to the positive stimuli (as well as the removal of negative stimuli), than when their behavior resulted in a negative response. While still careful to avoid the notions of “reward” and “punishment,” Skinner concluded that behavior was shaped much more efficiently by a program  of positive reinforcement. In fact,  he came to believe that negative reinforcement could even be counter-productive, with the subject continuing to seek positive responses for a specific behavior, despite this leading to a negative response in the majority of cases. This has implications in various areas of human behavior too; for example, in the use of disciplinary measures to teach children. If a  boy is continually being punished for something he finds enjoyable, such as picking his nose, he is likely to avoid doing so when adults are around. The child may modify his behavior, but only so far as it enables him to avoid punishment. Skinner himself believed that ultimately all forms of punishment were unsuitable for controlling children’s behavior.

     <p>Classical conditioning creates an automatic behavioral response to a neutral stimulus, such as salivating is expectation of food when a bell is rung.
