  <h1>Psychoanalysis</h1>

<div class="paragraph">

  <h2> Sigmund Freud </h2>
       <p> Born Sigismund Schlomo Freud in Freiberg, Moravia, Freud was openly his mothers's faforite child; she called him "Golden Siggie". When Freud was four years old, the family moved to Vienna and Sigismund became Sigmund. Sigmund completed a medical degree and in 1886he opened a medical practice specializing in neurology, and married Martha Bernays. Eventually, he developed the "talking cure" that was to becole an entirely new psychological approach: psychoanalysis.

  <h2> The Unconcious</h2>
       <p>The unconscious is one of the most intriguing concepts in psychology.  It seems to contain all of our experience of reality, although  it appears to be beyond our awareness or control. It is the place where we retain all our memories, thoughts, and feelings. The notion fascinated Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist Sigmund Freud, who wanted to find out if it was possible to explain things that seemed to lie beyond the confines of psychology at the time. Those who had begun to examine the unconscious feared that it might be filled with psychic activity that was too powerful, too frightening, or too incomprehensible for our conscious mind to be able  to incorporate. Freud’s work on  the subject was pioneering. He described the structure of the mind as formed of the conscious, the unconscious, and the preconscious, and he popularized the idea of the unconscious, introducing the notion that it is the part of the  mind that defines and explains  the workings behind our ability  to think and experience.

  <h2> Hypnosis and hysteria</h2>
       <p>Freud’s introduction to the world  of the unconscious came in 1885 when he came across the work  of the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who seemed to be successfully treating patients for symptoms of mental illness using hypnosis. Charcot’s view was  that hysteria was a neurological disorder caused by abnormalities  of the nervous system, and this idea provided important new possibilities for treatments. Freud returned to Vienna, eager to use this new knowledge, but struggled to find a workable technique. He then encountered Joseph Breuer, a well-respected physician, who had found that he could greatly reduce the severity of one of his patient’s symptoms of mental illness simply by asking her to describe her fantasies and hallucinations.  Breuer began using hypnosis to facilitate her access to memories of a traumatic event, and after twice-weekly hypnosis sessions all her symptoms had been alleviated. Breuer concluded that her symptoms had been the result  of disturbing memories buried in her unconscious mind, and that voicing the thoughts brought them to consciousness, allowing the symptoms to disappear. This is  the case of Anna O, and is the first instance of intensive psychotherapy as a treatment for mental illness. Breuer became Freud’s friend and colleague, and together the two developed and popularized a method of psychological treatment based on the idea that many forms of mental illness (irrational fears, anxiety, hysteria, imagined paralyses and pains, and certain types of paranoia) were the results of traumatic experiences that had occurred in the patient’s past  and were now hidden away from consciousness. Through Freud and Breuer’s technique, outlined in the jointly published Studies in Hysteria (1895), they claimed to have found a way to release the repressed memory from the unconscious, allowing the patient to consciously recall the memory and confront the experience, both emotionally and intellectually. The process set free the trapped emotion, and the symptoms disappeared. Breuer disagreed with what he felt was Freud’s eventual overemphasis on the sexual origins and content of neuroses (problems caused by psychological conflicts), and the two parted; Freud to continue developing the ideas and techniques of psychoanalysis.

  <h2>Our everyday mind</h2>
       <p>It is easy to take for granted the reality of the conscious, and naively believe that what we think, feel, remember, and experience make up the entirety of the human mind. But Freud says that the active state of consciousness—that is, the operational mind of which we are directly aware in  our everyday experience—is just a fraction of the total psychological forces at work in our psychical reality. The conscious exists at  the superficial level, to which we have easy and immediate access. Beneath the conscious lies the powerful dimensions of the unconscious, the warehouse  from which our active cognitive state and behavior are dictated. The conscious is effectively the puppet in the hands of the unconscious. The conscious  mind is merely the surface of  a complex psychic realm. Since the unconscious is all-encompassing, Freud says, it contains within it the smaller spheres of the conscious and an area called the “preconscious.” Everything that is conscious—that we actively know—has at one  time been unconscious  before rising to consciousness. However, not everything becomes consciously known; much of what is unconscious remains there.  Memories that are not in our everyday working memory, but which have not been repressed,reside in a part of the conscious mind that Freud called the preconscious. We are able to bring these memories into conscious awareness at any time. The unconscious acts as a receptacle for ideas or memories that are too powerful, too painful, or otherwise too much for the conscious mind to process. Freud believed that when certain ideas  or memories (and their associated emotions) threaten to overwhelm the psyche, they are split apart from a memory that can be accessed by the conscious mind, and stored in the unconscious instead.

  <h2>Psychoanalytical treatment</h2>
       <p>Since the unconscious remains inaccessible, the only way the conflicts can be recognized is through the symptoms that are present in the conscious. Emotional suffering, Freud claims, is the result of unconscious conflict. We cannot continually fight against ourselves, against the uprising of repressed material, and against the force of death, without emotional turmoil. Freud’s unique approach to the treatment of psychological ailments involved working with the conflicts that existed in the unconscious.  He sought to free the patient  from repressed memories and so alleviate their mental pain. His approach to treatment is called psychoanalytic psychotherapy, or psychoanalysis. This process is  not easy or quick. Psychoanalysis  is only performed by a therapist trained in Freud’s specific approach, and it is his therapythat encourages a patient to lie on  a couch and talk. From Freud’s first treatments, psychoanalysis has been practiced in sessions that  can sometimes last for hours, take  place several times per week, and continue for many years.  While unconscious thoughts cannot be retrieved through normal introspection, the unconscious can communicate with the conscious in some ways. It quietly communicates via our preferences, the frames of reference in which we tend to understand things, and the symbols that we are drawn to or create.During analysis, the analyst acts as a mediator, trying to allow unspoken thoughts or unbearable feelings to come to light. Messages arising from a conflict between the conscious and the unconscious are likely to be disguised, or encoded, and it is the psychoanalyst’s job to interpret the messages using the tools of psychoanalysis. There are several techniques that allow the unconscious to emerge. One of the first to be discussed  by Freud at length was dream analysis; he famously studied  his own dreams in his book, The Interpretation of Dreams. He claimed that every dream enacts  a wish fulfilment, and the more unpalatable the wish is to our conscious mind, the more hidden  or distorted the desire becomes in our dreams. So the unconscious,  he says, sends messages to our conscious mind in code. For instance, Freud discusses dreams where the dreamer is naked—the primary source for these dreams in most people is memories from early childhood, when nakedness was not frowned upon and there was  no sense of shame. In dreams where the dreamer feels embarrassment, the other people  in the dream generally seem oblivious, lending support to a wish-fulfilment interpretation where the dreamer wants to leave behind shame and restriction.  Even buildings and structures  have coded meanings; stairwells, mine shafts, locked doors, or a small building in a narrow recess all represent repressed sexual feelings, according to Freud.
